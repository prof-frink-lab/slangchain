    "## How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CandidatesGenerator\n",
    "\n",
    "The [CandidatesGenerator](../../../../../slangchain/graphs/anthropic/lats/lats.py) class is responsible for generating candidate responses given a prompt. It interfaces with a language model (LLM) and generates multiple candidate responses asynchronously.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `generate_candidates`: Generates candidate responses synchronously.\n",
    "- `from_tools`: Constructs a CandidatesGenerator instance from a sequence of BaseTool objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Node\n",
    "\n",
    "The Node class represents a node in the search tree. It stores information about messages exchanged in the conversation, reflections on responses, and handles tree traversal and backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LATS\n",
    "\n",
    "The [LATS](../../../../../slangchain/graphs/anthropic/lats/lats.py)  class is the main orchestrator of the tree search process. It initializes the workflow, defines the expansion and termination conditions, and executes the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `_call`: Executes the LATS search process.\n",
    "- `from_tools`: Constructs an LATS instance from a sequence of BaseTool objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The [LATS](../../../../../slangchain/graphs/anthropic/lats/lats.py) class orchestrates a tree-based search mechanism designed to generate and refine AI-generated responses. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its methods and operational flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`generate_initial_response(self, state: TreeState) -> Dict`**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Generates the initial response for the user's input and initializes the root node of the search tree.\n",
    "   - **Process**:\n",
    "     - Invokes the `initial_answer_chain` to get a preliminary response based on user input.\n",
    "     - Parses the response and manages any necessary tool invocations.\n",
    "     - Creates a `Node` representing the root of the search tree using the response and reflection data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`expand(self, state: TreeState, config: RunnableConfig) -> TreeState`**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Expands the existing search tree by generating new candidate responses from the current best node and exploring them.\n",
    "   - **Process**:\n",
    "     - Identifies the best candidate node to expand from.\n",
    "     - Generates new candidates via the `generate_candidates_chain` based on the messages of the best node.\n",
    "     - Parses and executes tool responses for each new candidate.\n",
    "     - Creates new nodes for each candidate and updates the tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`_should_loop(self, state: TreeState)`**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Determines whether the search should continue.\n",
    "   - **Criteria**:\n",
    "     - Checks if the root node has solved the problem.\n",
    "     - Checks if the tree has reached its maximum configured height.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`init_workflow_nodes(self) -> StateGraph`**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Initializes the nodes and edges in the workflow graph, which dictates the sequence of operations in the tree search.\n",
    "   - **Configuration**:\n",
    "     - Adds nodes like 'start' and 'expand' with corresponding methods.\n",
    "     - Configures conditional edges to decide whether to continue expanding or complete the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`_call(self, inputs: Dict[str, Any], run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForChainRun] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]`**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Executes the tree search based on the given inputs.\n",
    "   - **Process**:\n",
    "     - Initializes and compiles the workflow graph.\n",
    "     - Processes each step in the graph, dynamically moving through 'start', 'expand', or ending the process based on tree state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flow of Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**\n",
    "   - An instance of LATS is configured with specific tools, model settings, and parameters like `tree_height` and `reflection_retries`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Starting the Search**\n",
    "   - The process begins at the `start` node, where `generate_initial_response` is called to create the root of the tree based on the initial user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tree Expansion**\n",
    "   - The tree is expanded by iterating through the `expand` node. At each step:\n",
    "     - The best node to expand is selected based on specific criteria (e.g., highest value, least visited).\n",
    "     - New candidate nodes are generated and added as children of the best node.\n",
    "     - Reflections are performed on new nodes to evaluate and score responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Looping Decision**\n",
    "   - After each expansion, `_should_loop` is evaluated to decide whether to continue expanding or conclude the search. The search might end if the problem is solved (a node meets the criteria) or if the maximum tree depth is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Conclusion**\n",
    "   - The search concludes when `_should_loop` determines no further expansion is needed. The best solution or the state of the search is then returned as the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "By structuring the search this way, LATS efficiently manages a complex decision-making process, allowing for iterative refinement of AI-generated responses in a controlled and scalable manner."
